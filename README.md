Today, I chose three courses to study, one to study without listening. Alas, they are all very difficult subjects. I don't know if I can get high marks. It's really difficult to go abroad. I have to print a letter of recommendation tomorrow. I heard that the earth is about to enter the little ice age. Today's temperature is really hot enough.
